## Physics Engine
The physics engine of our fluid simulation implements [Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) proposed by Gingold and Monaghan in 1977 [[1]](#1). This can be found in [SPHEngine.cpp](SPHEngine.cpp), which in every cycle takes as input a 2D instantaneous global acceleration in polar coordinates to update the positions of particles in the simulation.

üí° If you want to use our physics engine for your own project, we've included an isolated version of it in [Prototyping/SPHEnginePybind.cpp](Prototyping/SPHEnginePybind.cpp) that you can interact with through a Jupyter notebook such as [Prototyping/physics_testbench.ipynb](Prototyping/physics_testbench.ipynb), thanks to the [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) project. A Python implementation that we used in the early stages of this project is also available in [Prototyping/physics_testbench_py.ipynb](Prototyping/physics_testbench_py.ipynb).


‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that this physics engine is designed to be compiled and ran on a PC instead of a microcontroller.

## System Architecture
We are designing an interactive LED matrix that simulates fluid motion in response to the system's tilt. Figure 2 shows the functional block diagram of the system. 

<img src="Assets/Project Functional Block Diagram.png" height="250" />
*Figure 2: Functional Block Diagram*

As illustrated in Figure 1, the system architecture is divided into three primary sections. The far-right segment comprises four full-sized breadboards, collectively housing our custom-designed GPU. This region includes the main Arduino UNO, responsible for generating all driving signals, and the array of logic IC chips that help distribute the signals.

To the left, a pair of breadboards make up the LED display section. This section houses the 16√ó9 LED matrix, the accelerometer, all the nMOSFETs, and the current-limiting resistors.\\

Finally, the single breadboard in between acts as an interface board. It organizes the signal connections from the logic gate array to the LED display, simplifying testing and debugging. This board also holds the secondary Arduino, which relays accelerometer data to the physics engine for real-time simulation. 

The Build of Materials can be found below in Table 1.
