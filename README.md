## Physics Engine
The physics engine of our fluid simulation implements [Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) proposed by Gingold and Monaghan in 1977 [[1]](#1). This can be found in [SPHEngine.cpp](SPHEngine.cpp), which in every cycle takes as input a 2D instaneously global acceleration in polar coordinates to update the positions of particles in the simulation.

üí° If you want to use our physics engine for your own project, we've included an isolated version of it in [Prototyping/SPHEnginePybind.cpp](Prototyping/SPHEnginePybind.cpp) that you can interact with through a Jupyter notebook such as [Prototyping/physics_testbench.ipynb](Prototyping/physics_testbench.ipynb), thanks to the [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) project. A Python implementation that we used in the early stages of this project is also available in [Prototyping/physics_testbench_py.ipynb](Prototyping/physics_testbench_py.ipynb).


‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that this physics engine is designed to be compiled and ran on a PC instead of a microcontroller.
